# FarmersMarket

Short exercise to create a checkout system for a farmer's market vendor.

# Pricing rules:
BOGO -- Buy-One-Get-One-Free Special on Coffee. (Unlimited)
APPL -- If you buy 3 or more bags of Apples, the price drops to $4.50.
CHMK -- Purchase a box of Chai and get milk free. (Limit 1)
The checkout system can apply any or all of these rules.

A user should be able to scan individual items and calculate the total cost at any time.
